# Find Columns
This repo is an experiment to see if I can use openCV to generate pretty good cropped images of newspaper columns

#running on windows
* open powershell
* run env\Scripts\activate.ps1
* run `python.exe .\findText.py`
* look at `columns` folder for output and `debugFiles` folder for intermidiate steps done to the image to find columns
